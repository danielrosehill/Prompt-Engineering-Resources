## Introduction

Limitations-aware Prompting is a technique in prompt engineering that involves designing prompts with a clear understanding of the limitations of the language model being used. This technique is based on the principle that language models, while powerful, have certain limitations and biases. By being aware of these limitations, one can design prompts that are more likely to yield accurate and useful responses.

## History

The concept of limitations-aware prompting is not new and has been a part of AI and machine learning practices for a while. However, it gained more attention with the advent of more advanced language models like GPT-3, where the understanding of model limitations became crucial for effective prompting.

## Use-Cases

Limitations-aware prompting can be useful in a variety of scenarios. For instance, when dealing with sensitive topics, understanding the limitations of the model can help avoid generating inappropriate or offensive responses. Similarly, in technical or specialized domains, being aware of the model's limitations can help design prompts that yield more accurate and relevant responses.

## Example

Let's say you're using a language model to generate responses about medical information. A limitations-aware prompt might look like this:

Prompt: "Can you provide a general explanation of diabetes, keeping in mind that you are an AI language model and not a medical professional?"

This prompt acknowledges the model's limitation (it's not a medical professional) and sets the expectation for the type of response (a general explanation).

## Advantages

The main advantage of limitations-aware prompting is that it can help generate more accurate and relevant responses. By acknowledging the model's limitations, you can guide it towards responses that are within its capabilities. This can also help avoid misunderstandings or misinterpretations of the model's responses.

## Drawbacks

The main drawback of limitations-aware prompting is that it requires a deep understanding of the model's limitations, which can be complex and time-consuming to acquire. Additionally, even with a good understanding of the model's limitations, there's no guarantee that the model will always respond as expected.

## LLMs

Limitations-aware prompting can be used with any language model, but it's especially useful with more advanced models like GPT-3. These models are more powerful and versatile, but they also have more complex limitations that need to be understood and accounted for.

## Tips

When using limitations-aware prompting, it's important to thoroughly understand the model's limitations. This might involve reading the model's documentation, testing the model with different prompts, and learning from the experiences of other users. It's also important to be flexible and willing to adjust your prompts as you learn more about the model's behavior.
