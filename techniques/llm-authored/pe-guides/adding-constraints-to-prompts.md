## Introduction

Adding constraints to prompts is a technique used in prompt engineering to guide the model's response in a specific direction. It involves specifying certain conditions or limitations in the prompt that the model must adhere to when generating a response. This technique is particularly useful when you want the model to generate responses that meet certain criteria or follow a specific format.

## History

The technique of adding constraints to prompts has been in use since the early days of AI and machine learning. It has become more prevalent with the advent of transformer-based models like GPT-3, which are capable of understanding and adhering to complex constraints specified in the prompts.

## Use-Cases

Adding constraints to prompts can be useful in a variety of scenarios:

1. **Content Generation**: If you want the model to generate a story or an article in a specific style or format, you can add constraints to the prompt specifying the desired style or format.

2. **Question Answering**: If you want the model to provide answers in a specific format (e.g., a single word, a sentence, a paragraph), you can add a constraint to the prompt specifying the desired format.

3. **Data Extraction**: If you want the model to extract specific pieces of information from a text, you can add constraints to the prompt specifying the information you want to extract.

## Example

Here's an example of adding constraints to a prompt:

Prompt without constraints: "Write a story."

Prompt with constraints: "Write a story set in the 19th century, featuring a detective and a mystery revolving around a stolen painting."

The second prompt guides the model to generate a story that meets the specified constraints.

## Advantages

1. **Control**: Adding constraints to prompts gives you more control over the model's output.

2. **Precision**: It can help the model generate more precise and relevant responses.

3. **Flexibility**: It allows you to customize the model's output to meet specific requirements.

## Drawbacks

1. **Over-specification**: If too many constraints are added, it might limit the model's creativity and result in unnatural or forced responses.

2. **Complexity**: Crafting prompts with the right constraints can be challenging and requires a good understanding of how the model interprets prompts.

## LLMs

Adding constraints to prompts works well with large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3, which have a good understanding of language and can interpret and adhere to complex constraints. However, the effectiveness of this technique can vary depending on the specific model and the complexity of the constraints.
