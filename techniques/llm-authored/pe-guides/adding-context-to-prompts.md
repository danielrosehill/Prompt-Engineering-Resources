## Introduction

Adding context to prompts is a technique used in the field of artificial intelligence, specifically in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. It involves providing additional information or setting the scene for a prompt to guide the AI model's response. This technique helps the model to understand the context better and generate more accurate and relevant responses.

## History

The technique of adding context to prompts has been in use since the advent of conversational AI and chatbots. However, it gained more prominence with the development of advanced language models like GPT-3 by OpenAI, which demonstrated a remarkable ability to understand and generate human-like text based on the context provided.

## Use-Cases

1. **Chatbots**: Adding context to prompts is crucial in chatbot applications to maintain the flow of conversation and provide relevant responses.
2. **Content Generation**: In content generation tasks like article writing or story generation, adding context can help the model generate more coherent and relevant content.
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Providing context can help the model understand the sentiment behind a statement better.
4. **Question Answering Systems**: In these systems, adding context can help the model understand the question better and provide more accurate answers.

## Example

Without Context:
Prompt: "What is the weather like?"

With Context:
Prompt: "I am planning a picnic in New York tomorrow. What is the weather like?"

In the second prompt, the model is given context about the location (New York) and the time (tomorrow), which will help it generate a more accurate and relevant response.

## Advantages

1. **Improved Accuracy**: Adding context can significantly improve the accuracy of the model's responses.
2. **Relevance**: It ensures that the responses generated by the model are relevant to the situation or conversation.
3. **Coherence**: It helps maintain the coherence and flow of a conversation or a piece of text generated by the model.

## Drawbacks

1. **Overfitting**: Too much context can lead to overfitting, where the model becomes too tailored to the training data and performs poorly on new, unseen data.
2. **Complexity**: Adding context increases the complexity of the prompt and may require more computational resources.

## LLMs

Adding context to prompts works well with large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3, which have been trained on diverse and extensive datasets. These models have a better understanding of language and can effectively use the context provided to generate accurate and relevant responses. However, the effectiveness of this technique can vary depending on the specific task and the amount of context provided.
