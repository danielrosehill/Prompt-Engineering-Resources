## Introduction

Scaffolding Prompting is a technique used in the field of AI and machine learning, specifically in natural language processing (NLP). It involves structuring a prompt in a way that guides the AI model towards generating the desired output. This is done by providing a framework or 'scaffold' in the form of a series of questions or statements that lead the model to the correct response.

## History

The concept of scaffolding in education has been around for decades, but its application in AI and machine learning is relatively new. It emerged as a technique to improve the performance of AI models, particularly in tasks that require complex reasoning or understanding of context. The exact date of its emergence is hard to pinpoint, but it has gained prominence with the rise of transformer-based models like GPT-3.

## Use-Cases

Scaffolding Prompting can be used in a variety of scenarios where a specific output is desired from an AI model. For instance, it can be used in customer service chatbots to guide the conversation towards resolving a customer's issue. It can also be used in AI tutoring systems to guide a student's learning process. Additionally, it can be used in content generation tasks to ensure the generated content meets certain criteria.

## Example

Here's an example of Scaffolding Prompting in practice:

Prompt: "As an AI model, I can help you with a variety of tasks. For instance, if you need to write an essay on the impact of climate change, I could start by asking you some guiding questions. What aspect of climate change are you most interested in? What is your thesis statement? What are some key points you want to include in your essay?"

## Advantages

Scaffolding Prompting has several advantages. It can help guide the AI model towards generating more relevant and useful outputs. It can also help in tasks that require complex reasoning or understanding of context, as it provides a framework for the model to follow. Additionally, it can help in reducing the amount of training data required, as the model can learn to generate the desired output from the scaffolded prompts.

## Drawbacks

However, Scaffolding Prompting also has some drawbacks. It requires a good understanding of the task at hand and the AI model's capabilities to create effective scaffolds. It can also be time-consuming to create these scaffolds, particularly for complex tasks. Additionally, it may not always lead to the desired output, as the model may not always follow the scaffold as intended.

## LLMs

Scaffolding Prompting works well with large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3, as these models have a good understanding of context and can generate coherent and relevant responses. However, it can also be used with smaller models with some degree of success.

## Tips

When using Scaffolding Prompting, it's important to have a clear understanding of the task and the desired output. The scaffold should be structured in a way that guides the model towards this output. It's also important to test the scaffold with different inputs to ensure it works as intended. Avoid making the scaffold too complex, as this can confuse the model and lead to incorrect outputs.
