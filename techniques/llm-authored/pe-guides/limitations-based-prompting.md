## Introduction

Limitations-based Prompting is a technique in the field of AI and machine learning where the prompts are designed to work within the limitations of the model. This technique acknowledges the fact that AI models have certain limitations and instead of trying to push the boundaries, it works within them to get the best possible output. 

## History

The concept of limitations-based prompting has been around since the early days of AI and machine learning. However, it has gained more prominence with the advent of more complex models like GPT-3, where the limitations of the model are more pronounced and need to be taken into account while designing prompts.

## Use-Cases

Limitations-based prompting can be used in a variety of scenarios. For instance, when dealing with a model that struggles with long-term dependencies, the prompts can be designed to focus on short-term dependencies. Similarly, if a model has a limited vocabulary, the prompts can be designed using the words that the model is familiar with. This technique is also useful in scenarios where the model is not very good at understanding context or nuances.

## Example

Let's say we are working with a model that struggles with understanding complex sentences. Instead of using a prompt like "What is the capital of the country that is located in the northern part of the continent that is home to the Amazon rainforest?", we can use a simpler prompt like "What is the capital of Brazil?".

## Advantages

The main advantage of limitations-based prompting is that it allows us to get the best possible output from the model by working within its limitations. It also helps in reducing the chances of the model producing incorrect or nonsensical outputs.

## Drawbacks

The main drawback of this technique is that it can limit the complexity of the tasks that the model can perform. Also, it requires a good understanding of the model's limitations, which can be difficult to ascertain in some cases.

## LLMs

Limitations-based prompting works well with all models, but it is especially useful with models that have pronounced limitations. For instance, it can be very effective with models that have a limited vocabulary or struggle with understanding context or nuances.

## Tips

When using limitations-based prompting, it is important to have a good understanding of the model's limitations. Also, it is important to keep the prompts simple and straightforward. Avoid using complex sentences or words that the model might not understand. Finally, it is important to test the prompts thoroughly to ensure that they are working as expected.
