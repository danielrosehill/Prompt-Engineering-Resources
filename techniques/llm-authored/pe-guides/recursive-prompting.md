## Introduction

Recursive Prompting is a technique used in the field of AI and machine learning, specifically in natural language processing (NLP). It involves the use of a series of prompts that build upon each other to guide the AI model towards a more specific or complex response. The model's response to one prompt becomes the input for the next prompt, creating a recursive loop that allows for more nuanced and detailed responses.

## History

The concept of recursive prompting has been around since the early days of AI and machine learning, but it has gained more attention with the advent of more advanced NLP models like GPT-3. These models' ability to understand and generate human-like text has made recursive prompting a more viable and effective technique.

## Use-Cases

Recursive prompting can be used in a variety of scenarios where a more detailed or complex response from the AI model is required. For example, it can be used in customer service chatbots to guide the conversation and provide more specific solutions. It can also be used in AI tutoring systems to provide more detailed explanations or to guide the student through a complex problem-solving process.

## Example

Here's an example of recursive prompting in action:

1. Prompt: "What is the capital of France?"
   Response: "The capital of France is Paris."

2. Prompt: "What is Paris known for?"
   Response: "Paris is known for its iconic landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, Louvre Museum, and Notre-Dame Cathedral."

3. Prompt: "Tell me more about the Eiffel Tower."
   Response: "The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower."

## Advantages

The main advantage of recursive prompting is that it allows for more detailed and nuanced responses from the AI model. It can guide the model towards a specific topic or line of reasoning, and it can help the model generate more complex and coherent narratives.

## Drawbacks

The main drawback of recursive prompting is that it requires careful design and planning of the prompts to ensure that they build upon each other in a meaningful way. If the prompts are not well-designed, the model's responses may not be coherent or relevant.

## LLMs

Recursive prompting works well with large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 that have a good understanding of human language and can generate coherent and contextually relevant responses.

## Tips

When using recursive prompting, it's important to carefully design the sequence of prompts to ensure that they build upon each other in a meaningful way. It's also important to test and iterate on the prompts to ensure that they elicit the desired responses from the model. Avoid using too many prompts in a sequence, as this can lead to confusion and incoherence in the model's responses.
