## Introduction

Expectation-setting prompting is a technique used in AI model training where the prompt is designed to set clear expectations about the desired output. This technique is particularly useful in guiding the model to generate responses that are more aligned with the user's intent. It involves providing explicit instructions or context to the model to help it understand the kind of response that is expected.

## History

The concept of expectation-setting prompting has been around since the early days of AI and machine learning. However, it has gained more prominence with the advent of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3, where the ability to guide the model's output through the prompt has become increasingly important.

## Use-Cases

Expectation-setting prompting can be used in a variety of scenarios, including:

1. **Customer Support**: To generate specific responses to customer queries.
2. **Content Generation**: To guide the model in generating content in a specific style or format.
3. **Data Analysis**: To instruct the model to analyze data in a certain way and provide specific insights.

## Example

Here's an example of expectation-setting prompting:

Prompt: "Write a short, suspenseful story set in a haunted house."

The expectation here is clear: the model is expected to generate a short story that is suspenseful and set in a haunted house.

## Advantages

1. **Better Control**: This technique gives users more control over the model's output.
2. **Improved Relevance**: It can help ensure that the model's output is more relevant to the user's needs.
3. **Reduced Ambiguity**: By setting clear expectations, it reduces the chances of the model generating ambiguous or irrelevant responses.

## Drawbacks

1. **Requires Skill**: Crafting effective expectation-setting prompts requires a certain level of skill and understanding of the model's behavior.
2. **Limited Flexibility**: This technique may limit the model's ability to generate creative or unexpected responses.

## LLMs

Expectation-setting prompting works well with large language models like GPT-3, which have the ability to understand and follow complex instructions provided in the prompt.

## Tips

1. **Be Explicit**: Clearly state your expectations in the prompt.
2. **Provide Context**: If necessary, provide enough context to help the model understand the task.
3. **Test and Refine**: Experiment with different prompts and refine them based on the model's responses.
4. **Avoid Overcomplication**: While it's important to be clear, avoid making the prompt overly complicated as it might confuse the model.
