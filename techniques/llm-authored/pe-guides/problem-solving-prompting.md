## Introduction

Problem-solving prompting is a technique used in the field of AI model training, where the model is given a problem to solve and is prompted to generate a solution. This technique is particularly useful in training models to think critically and analytically, and to generate creative and innovative solutions. It is often used in fields such as mathematics, science, and engineering, where problem-solving skills are crucial.

## History

The problem-solving prompting technique has been in use since the early days of AI and machine learning. It emerged as a way to train models to solve complex problems, and has since been refined and improved upon. The technique has been used in various forms, from simple problem-solving tasks to complex, multi-step problems.

## Use-Cases

Problem-solving prompting can be used in a variety of scenarios. For example, it can be used to train a model to solve mathematical problems, to generate solutions to engineering problems, or to come up with innovative ideas for product development. It can also be used in fields such as medicine, where AI models are trained to diagnose diseases and suggest treatments.

## Example

An example of problem-solving prompting in practice might be training a model to solve a complex mathematical problem. The prompt might be: "Solve the following equation: 2x + 3 = 7". The model would then be expected to generate the solution: "x = 2".

## Advantages

The main advantage of problem-solving prompting is that it trains models to think critically and analytically. It encourages creativity and innovation, and can help models to generate novel solutions to complex problems. It can also help to improve a model's problem-solving skills over time, as it is exposed to a variety of different problems.

## Drawbacks

One of the main drawbacks of problem-solving prompting is that it can be time-consuming. Training a model to solve complex problems often requires a lot of data and computational resources. Additionally, the technique may not be effective for all types of problems, and may not work as well with certain types of models.

## LLMs

Problem-solving prompting works particularly well with models that are designed for critical thinking and problem-solving, such as decision tree models and neural networks. However, it may not work as well with simpler models that are not designed for complex problem-solving.

## Tips

When using problem-solving prompting, it's important to start with simpler problems and gradually increase the complexity as the model improves. It's also important to provide a variety of different problems, to ensure that the model is exposed to a range of scenarios. Finally, it's crucial to provide clear and accurate feedback, to help the model learn and improve.
