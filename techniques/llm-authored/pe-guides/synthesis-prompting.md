## Introduction

Synthesis Prompting is a technique used in the field of artificial intelligence, specifically in natural language processing. It involves creating prompts that require the AI model to synthesize information from multiple sources or pieces of information to generate a response. This technique is designed to encourage the AI model to think critically and combine different pieces of information to create a comprehensive and coherent response.

## History

The concept of Synthesis Prompting has been around since the advent of AI models capable of understanding and generating human language. However, it has gained more attention with the development of more advanced AI models like GPT-3, which have the ability to understand context and synthesize information more effectively.

## Use-Cases

Synthesis Prompting can be used in a variety of scenarios where an AI model is required to generate a response based on multiple pieces of information. For example, it can be used in customer service chatbots to generate responses based on the customer's query and the information available in the database. It can also be used in AI tutors to generate explanations based on the student's question and the information in the course material.

## Example

Here is an example of Synthesis Prompting in practice:

Prompt: "Based on the following information: (1) Apples are a type of fruit. (2) Fruits are healthy and contain vitamins. (3) Vitamins are essential for the human body. Synthesize a paragraph explaining why apples are good for health."

Expected Response: "Apples, being a type of fruit, are inherently healthy. They are packed with vitamins, which are essential nutrients that the human body needs to function properly. Therefore, consuming apples contributes to overall health by providing these necessary vitamins."

## Advantages

The main advantage of Synthesis Prompting is that it encourages the AI model to generate more thoughtful and comprehensive responses. It also helps the model to better understand the context and the relationships between different pieces of information. This can lead to more accurate and useful responses.

## Drawbacks

The main drawback of Synthesis Prompting is that it requires a more advanced AI model to work effectively. If the model is not capable of understanding context or synthesizing information, the responses may not be accurate or useful. It also requires more careful and thoughtful prompt design.

## LLMs

Synthesis Prompting works especially well with large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3. These models have been trained on a vast amount of data and have the ability to understand context and synthesize information effectively.

## Tips

When using Synthesis Prompting, it's important to design your prompts carefully. Make sure to provide all the necessary information and make the task clear. Also, keep in mind that the effectiveness of this technique depends on the capabilities of the AI model you are using. It's best suited for more advanced models that can understand context and synthesize information.
