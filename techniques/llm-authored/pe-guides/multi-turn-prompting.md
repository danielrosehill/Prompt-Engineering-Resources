## Introduction

Multi-turn prompting is a technique used in conversational AI where the model is given a series of prompts or questions, rather than a single one. This technique is designed to simulate a more natural, human-like conversation, where the AI model responds to a series of related prompts, rather than just one isolated question. This technique is particularly useful in creating more engaging and interactive AI experiences.

## History

The concept of multi-turn prompting has been around since the early days of conversational AI and chatbots. However, it has gained more prominence with the advent of more advanced AI models like GPT-3, which have the ability to understand and respond to complex, multi-turn prompts.

## Use-Cases

Multi-turn prompting is particularly useful in scenarios where a single question or prompt is not sufficient to get the desired response. For example, in customer service chatbots, a user might have multiple related queries. Instead of asking each query separately, the chatbot can use multi-turn prompting to ask follow-up questions and provide a more comprehensive response.

## Example

Here's an example of multi-turn prompting in action:

User: "What's the weather like today?"
AI: "It's sunny and 75 degrees."
User: "What about tomorrow?"
AI: "Tomorrow's forecast is partly cloudy with a high of 78 degrees."

In this example, the AI model is using the context of the previous prompt ("What's the weather like today?") to understand and respond to the follow-up prompt ("What about tomorrow?").

## Advantages

The main advantage of multi-turn prompting is that it allows for more natural and engaging conversations. It also allows the AI model to provide more comprehensive and contextually relevant responses. Furthermore, it can help in reducing the number of prompts needed to get the desired response, thereby improving the efficiency of the conversation.

## Drawbacks

One of the main drawbacks of multi-turn prompting is that it requires a more complex model that can understand and respond to multiple related prompts. This can make the model more resource-intensive and potentially slower. Additionally, if the model does not correctly understand the context of the previous prompts, it can lead to incorrect or irrelevant responses.

## LLMs

Multi-turn prompting works particularly well with large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3. These models have been trained on a vast amount of data and have the ability to understand and respond to complex, multi-turn prompts.

## Tips

When using multi-turn prompting, it's important to ensure that the prompts are related and follow a logical sequence. Also, it's crucial to test the model thoroughly to ensure that it correctly understands the context of the previous prompts. Lastly, while multi-turn prompting can make the conversation more engaging, it's important not to overuse it, as it can make the conversation unnecessarily complex and confusing for the user.
