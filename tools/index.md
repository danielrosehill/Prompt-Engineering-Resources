title: "Tools Index"

Note:

I'm adding tools to `index.md` in the first instance and will then (manually, perhaps later auomatically) put things into the right categories (if you're viewing this on my docs site, that's the sidebar!)

In other words: changes to the category pages will lag a little.

Also: if I'm missed your tool, sorry! Please [drop me a line](mailto:public@danielrosehill.com).
